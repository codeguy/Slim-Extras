# Slim Framework Extras

This repository contains extra resources that complement the Slim Framework, a PHP micro framework that helps
you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications.

## Custom Views

This repository contains custom views for your Slim Framework applications. Custom views let you easily
use popular third-party templating frameworks, like [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) or
[Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/), with your Slim Framework application.

* [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/)
* [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
* [Mustache](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php)
* [Haml](https://code.google.com/p/phamlp/)
* [Haanga](http://haanga.org/)
* [Blitz](http://alexeyrybak.com/blitz/blitz_en.html)
* [Dwoo](http://dwoo.org/)
* [Sugar](http://php-sugar.net/)
* [Savant](http://phpsavant.com/)
* [Rain](http://www.raintpl.com/)
* [H2o](http://www.h2o-template.org/)

This example demonstrates how to use the custom Twig view in your Slim Framework application:

    <?php
    // Setup custom Twig view
    $twigView = new \Slim\Extras\Views\Twig();

    // Instantiate application
    $app = new \Slim\Slim(array(
        'view' => $twigView
    ));

This example assumes you are autoloading dependencies using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). If you are not
using Composer, you must manually `require` the custom view class before instantiating it.

Read the [Slim Framework documentation](http://docs.slimframework.com/pages/view-custom/) to learn how to write
your own custom view.

## Middleware

This repository also contains middleware for your Slim Framework application. This
example demonstrates how to apply HTTP basic authentication to a Slim Framework application:

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();
    $app->add(new \Slim\Extras\Middleware\HttpBasicAuth('username', 'password'));

This example assumes you are autoloading dependencies using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). If you are not
using Composer, you must manually `require` the custom middleware class before instantiating it.

## Log Writers

This repository also contains custom log writers for your Slim Framwork application. This example
demonstrates how to use the custom `DateTimeLogWriter` to write rolling log files from your Slim Framework application:

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim(array(
        'log.writer' => new \Slim\Extras\Log\DateTimeFileWriter(array(
            'path' => './logs',
            'name_format' => 'Y-m-d',
            'message_format' => '%label% - %date% - %message%'
        ))
    ));

This example assumes you are autoloading dependencies using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). If you are not
using Composer, you must manually `require` the log writer class before instantiating it.

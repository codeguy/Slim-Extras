 * View_Haanga
 *
 * The View_Haanga is a custom View class that renders templates using the Haanga
 * template language (http://haanga.org/).
 *
 * Currently, to use View_Haanga, developer must instantiate this class and pass these params:
 * - path to Haanga directory which contain `lib`
 * - path to templates directory
 * - path to compiled templates directory
 *
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *      require_once 'view/Haanga.php';
 *      Slim::init(array(
 *          'view' => new View_Haanga('/path/to/Haanga/dir', '/path/to/templates/dir', '/path/to/compiled/dir')
 *      ));
 * }}}

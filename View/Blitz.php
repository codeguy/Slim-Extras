 * View_Blitz
 *
 * The BlitzView provides native support for the Blitz templating system
 * for PHP. Blitz is written as C and compiled to a PHP extension. Which means
 * it is FAST. You can learn more about Blitz at:
 *
 * <http://alexeyrybak.com/blitz/blitz_en.html>
 *
 * The xBlitz extended blitz class provides better block handling
 * (load assoc arrays correctly, one level)
